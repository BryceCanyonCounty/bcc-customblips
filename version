<2.0>

- Essentially a rewrite.
- Updated to new core exports
- Revamped the Restriction & Requirements checks for each blip.
  - It now has the option to set each individual blips as public, job locked, or group locked.
  - I've consolidated the "requirements" in to a single table to help with confusion over which restriction is in place.
  - Updated some of the distance logic within the client side to help with performance by checking global vars first before doing a distance check.
- Added Version checker.

<1.0>
