# Custom Blips

This is a very simple script that allows blips to be placed anywhere on the map by providing the blip id and x,y,z coordinates.

To add blips open the Config.lua file and add in your custom locations.

```lua
{
    name = "Tubleweed Sheriff Office",
    ID = 1047294027,
    Pos = {x = -5529.71, y = -2927.65, z = -1.36}
},
```
You can find the blip ID's [here](https://filmcrz.github.io/blips/)
